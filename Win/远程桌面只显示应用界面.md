- # [Can RDP clients launch remote applications and not desktops](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1226772/can-rdp-clients-launch-remote-applications-and-not-desktops)

## This is quite easily achievable.

1. We need to allow any unlisted programs to start from RDP.  
    1.1 Save the script below on your desktop, the extension must end with .reg.  
    

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Terminal Server\TSAppAllowList]
    "fDisabledAllowList"=dword:00000001

  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.2 Right click on the file and clickÂ Merge,Â Yes,Â Ok.  
  

2. Modifying our .rdp file.  
    2.1 At the end of our file, add the following code:  
    

remoteapplicationmode:i:1
remoteapplicationname:s:This will be the optional description of the app
remoteapplicationprogram:s:Relative or absolute path to the app
                           (Example: taskmgr or C:\Windows\system32\taskmgr.exe)
remoteapplicationcmdline:s:Here you'd put any optional application parameters

---

Or just use this one to make sure that it works:  

remoteapplicationmode:i:1
remoteapplicationname:s:
remoteapplicationprogram:s:mspaint
remoteapplicationcmdline:s:

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.2 Enter your username and password and connect.  

  
Â Â Â Â 3. Now you can use your RemoteApp without any issues as if it was running on your local machine ðŸ˜‰

- The excellent answer above uses theÂ `remoteapplicationprogram:s`Â key to specify an application residing on theÂ **remote**Â computer. To run a local,Â **host-side**Â application on the remote computer, use theÂ `remoteapplicationfile:s`Â key instead.Â

    This works perfectly, only thing that wasn't 100% clear is that the reg has to be run on the remote machineÂ
