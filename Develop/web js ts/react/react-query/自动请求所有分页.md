This is the default react-query refetching behaviour: An infinite query only has _one_ cache entry, with multiple pages. When a refetch happens, all currently visible pages will be refetched. This is documented [here](https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/infinite-queries#what-happens-when-an-infinite-query-needs-to-be-refetched).

Now the real question is, do you want ==a refetch or not== <u>when the filter changes</u>? 
If not, then setting a **`staleTime`** would be the best solution.
If you do want a refetch, *refetching all pages is the safest option*. Otherwise, ==you can try to remove all pages but the first one with `queryClient.setQueryData`== when your query unmounts. react-query won't do that automatically because why would we delete data that the user has scrolled down to to see already.

Also note that for imperative refetches, like `invalidateQueries`, you have the option to pass a `refetchPage` function, where you can return a boolean for each page to indicate if it should be refetched or not. This is helpful if you only update one item and only want to refetch the page where this item resides. This is documented [here](https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/infinite-queries#refetchpage).
