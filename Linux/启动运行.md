One approach is to add an @reboot cron task: 

1. Running crontab -e will allow you to edit your cron.
2. Adding a line like this to it: 
```
screen -d -m yourcommand
@reboot su test -c 'screen -dm ~/shell/tunnel-remote.sh manong@ql 2222 22'

@reboot su apollo -c 'nohup /home/apollo/tools/ssh-forward >/dev/null &'
```

```
#if [[ $(id -u) -ne 0 ]]; then
# echo "Please run as root"
# exit
#fi


REMOTE_lISTENING_PORT=${2:-'12300'}
LOCAL_PROXY_PORT=${3:-'12300'}


while true
do
echo $(date)" ssh tunnel start..."


ssh -NT -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes -o ServerAliveInterval=60 -o ServerAliveCountMax=100 \
-R localhost:${REMOTE_lISTENING_PORT}:localhost:${LOCAL_PROXY_PORT} ${1}


sleep 30
done
```

You can see that the head comment contains lines such as: 

# This unit gets pulled automatically into multi-user.target by
# systemd-rc-local-generator if /etc/rc.local is executable.

This indicates, that in this system, if there is a file called /etc/rc.local which is executable, then it will be pulled into multi-user.target automatically. So you just create the according file (sudo touch...) and make it executable (sudo chmod +x ...).
