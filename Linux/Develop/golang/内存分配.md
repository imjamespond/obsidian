The make built-in function allocates and initializes an object of type slice, map, or chan (only).
func make(t Type, size ...IntegerType) Type
func new(Type) *Type

Unlike regular variable declarations, a short variable declaration may redeclare variables provided they were originally declared earlier in the same block with the same type, and at least one of the non-blank variables is new. As a consequence, redeclaration can only appear in a multi-variable short declaration. Redeclaration does not introduce a new variable; it just assigns a new value to the original.
